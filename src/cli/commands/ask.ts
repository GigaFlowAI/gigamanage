/**
 * `gm ask` — ask questions about your sessions.
 *
 * Two shapes, one implementation:
 *
 *   gm ask                  a REPL. What ctrl-o in the picker opens.
 *   gm ask "<question>"     one-shot, for a shell or an agent.
 *   gm ask "<q>" --json     the same, parseable.
 *
 * The one-shot is not a convenience — non-negotiable #4 says every read command
 * supports `--json`, and an agent can only use what it can parse.
