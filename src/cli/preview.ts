 * **No conversation ⇒ the card gets the whole pane, byte-identical to today.**
 * That is the deal, not a nicety: a picker run where nobody presses ctrl-o must
 * render exactly what it rendered before this file existed. It needs no flag and
 * no branch — a missing transcript reads as zero events, `splitPreview` hands the
 * card every row, and `formatPreview` returns `formatCard` and nothing else.
 *
 * **Nothing here calls a model, and nothing here may ever learn how.** The
 * preview command re-runs on every cursor move, so a model call in this file is
 * a model call per keystroke. The chat renders from the transcript file or it
 * does not render.
 *
 * **Monochrome, like the pane already is.** The preview's stdout is a pipe, not a
 * tty, so `format.ts` gates every colour off and `formatCard` has emitted zero
 * ANSI here since it shipped. `dim`/`bold`/`cyan` below are therefore identity
 * functions today; they cost nothing and are correct the day the pane gains
 * colour. Which is why the divider is carried by GLYPHS and the speakers by
 * LAYOUT — neither depends on colour existing.
