/**
 * Where gigamanage keeps its own state. It never writes anywhere else.
 *
 * Two directories and one narrow third category, and the split matters:
 *
 * - `cacheDir()` — derived data. Keyed by content hash, thrown away safely.
 * - `configDir()` — what a human chose. `rm -rf` the cache and you should lose
 *   summaries, not your provider. Anything a person typed belongs here.
 * - **Ephemeral IPC** — a scratch buffer one live process writes and its own
 *   children read, dead the moment that process is, never read by a later run,
 *   safe to `rm` at any instant. It lives under `cacheDir()` *even though it
 *   holds typed text*, because "disposable" is what the cache means and this is
 *   disposable by construction. `askTranscriptDir()` is its ONLY member. The
 *   category is named here and in AGENTS.md #1 rather than left as a habit,
 *   because a rule with an unwritten exception is a rule the next person
 *   "fixes".
