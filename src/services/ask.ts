/**
 * Ask: questions about the sessions you already have, answered from the
 * summaries you already paid for.
 *
 * The design decision worth knowing before you change anything here:
 *
 * **The tool loop is the harness's, not ours.** The prompt tells the model it
 * may run `gm grep '<query>' --json`, and the provider is invoked with exactly
 * that permission (see providers.ts `askArgv`). We parse no tool calls and speak
 * no vendor protocol — the abstraction stays "a CLI that reads a prompt and
 * writes text", which is the only reason gigamanage depends on no vendor SDK.
 *
 * The cost is that we don't meter how many greps the model runs. Accepted: grep
 * is read-only and cheap, and the provider's own turn limit bounds it.
 *
 * The context block is bounded the way `distill()` is bounded — a few KB
 * regardless of how many sessions you have — because a REPL re-sends it every
 * turn.
