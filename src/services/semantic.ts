 * — and gmux's fast path (sensors, gate, state transitions, the socket) must
 * never notice. `SemanticWorker` is a bounded concurrent pool keyed by pane:
 * `enqueue` never awaits the provider, coalesces a pane's pending job (newest
 * observation wins), and lets `concurrency` jobs run side by side. One pane
 * hanging never keeps another pane's label from landing.

 * don't share a prompt shape.
