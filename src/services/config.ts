/**
 * Config: the one thing gigamanage remembers because a human said so.
 *
 * Everything else in `~/.cache/gigamanage` is derived and disposable. This
 * isn't, which is why it lives under the config dir instead — see core/paths.ts.
 *
 * Two rules run through this file:
 *
 * 1. **A bad config is not an error.** Unreadable, malformed, or written by a
 *    future version — all are treated as *absent*. `gm ls` must not die because
 *    a JSON file got truncated; it should fall back to the behavior of someone
 *    who never ran `gm setup`, which is a behavior that works.
 * 2. **The env var wins.** `GIGAMANAGE_SUMMARY_CMD` sat on top before config
 *    existed, and every script, test and CI job that sets it must keep working
 *    without being told about a new file.
