/**
 * The catalog of model CLIs gigamanage knows how to call.
 *
 * This is deliberately NOT `adapters/registry.ts`, and the two must not be
 * merged. They are different axes that only coincidentally share names today:
 *
 * - An **adapter** reads sessions off disk. It answers "what happened?"
 * - A **provider** makes a model call. It answers "what does it mean?"
 *
 * You might read Claude Code transcripts while running summaries through Codex.
 * A provider may exist that no adapter parses. Conflating them would couple two
 * things that have no reason to move together.
 *
 * A provider is described by argv, not by an SDK. That is the entire abstraction
 * — see docs/architecture.md — and it is why adding one is four lines here.
